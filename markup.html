        <h1> ATHN markup language specification </h1>
        <p> Project ATHN is still very early in development. Suggestions and discussion are very welcome. Expect everything to change at any time. </p>
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> ATHN markup language is the backbone of the project, it's the plain text format that makes up every ATHN site. It's intended to be protocol agnostic. Right now https is used to exchange the markup files, but in theory any other protocol, maybe even a custom one specifically tailored to the needs of this project, could be used for that purpose </p>
