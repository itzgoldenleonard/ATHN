        <h1> Software repository </h1>
        <h2> Browser software </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://github.com/itzgoldenleonard/reference-browser-gnome"> Gnome reference browser. Linux/Gnome. </a> </p>

        <h2> Server software </h2>
        <p> As of now ATHN still uses https as its primary protocol which means that you can use any web server to host an ATHN site. </p>
        <h2> Format conversion, proxies and middleware </h2>
        <h2> Development tools </h2>
        <h2> Other </h2>

        <h1> Roadmap </h1>
        <p> This is a roadmap of the different stages of maturity of project ATHN and what software will be most important to make in those stages. We're currently heading into the first stage, the draft stage. </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>The draft stage:</strong> Very unstable standards. The most important thing right now is to get enough people (primarily technical) using the project that we can develop the standards to a point where they're good enough to progress to the next stage. This stage is about moving fast, trying things out, and finding out what works and what doesnt, our attention should be mostly on the standards. </li>
            <p> <strong>Software needed:</strong> A usable browser, a usable server </p>
            <li> <strong>The popularization stage: </strong> Standards are still not stable, but mostly in place. This stage is about scaling, getting the more average users to start using ATHN. And about polishing the standards with the experiences we get from that, this is the stage where the base standards are finalized. One crucial piece of software needed to progress to this stage is an ATHN to web proxy, this is neccessary to allow people to switch to ATHN (with all the benefits) without losing the audience that is the web. Without this proxy it wouldnt be worth it or feasable for most people to make the switch because of the loss of audience. </li>
            <p> <strong>Software needed: </strong> A basic ATHN-web proxy, a usable browser for every major platform, usable servers for every major use case </p>
            <li> <strong>The release stage:</strong> First stable release of the base standards, from now on they wont have any breaking changes. It's possible that we could be working on companion standards at this stage. This stage is about developing very stable, easy to use and high quality software for ATHN. But also about finding out what we can do with this now stable project. It's also a time for growth because at this stage it should be safe and easy for anyone to get on board </li>
            <p> <strong>Software needed:</strong> A fully featured ATHN-web proxy (both software and service), A free (for basic use cases) ATHN site hosting service, rock solid browsers for every major platform, rock solid servers for every major use case, at least one goodd document validation client </p>
